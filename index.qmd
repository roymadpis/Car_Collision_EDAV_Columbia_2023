# Introduction

This project will analyze car accidents and collisions within Montgomery County in United States. Our goal is to understand what attributes or combination of attributes are more correlated with the number of accidents and their severity. Indeed, in 2022, 42,795 peoples died on the road in United States. Understanding the leading factors in car accidents can help policy makers to focus their efforts on the conditions which seems more favorable to cause car accidents. For instance, our data visualization might reveal that some roads are more dangerous than others and thus they need to be improved by the state of 
Maryland. Or maybe at specific times of the week more accidents happen, then driver should be aware of this and take more precaution driving at this specific time.

Overall, the goals of this project is to highlight compelling correlations between the number of accidents over the years and the different features of the data set. This aims for both educating drivers on what to be aware on the road and showcasing to government officials the infrastructure they can improve.
