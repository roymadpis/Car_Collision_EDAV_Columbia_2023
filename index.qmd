# Introduction

This project will analyze car accidents and collisions within Montgomery County in United States. Our goal is to understand what attributes or combination of attributes are more correlated with the number of accidents and their severity. Indeed, in 2022, 42,795 peoples died on the road in United States. Understanding the leading factors in car accidents can help policymakers to focus their efforts on the conditions which seems more favorable to cause car accidents. For instance, our data visualization could unveil that certain roads pose a higher risk, thereby necessitating improvement by the state of Maryland. Similarly, if accidents tend to occur more frequently during specific times of the week, drivers should be made aware, encouraging them to exercise extra caution during those particular hours.

Overall, the goals of this project is to highlight compelling correlations between the number of accidents over the years and the different features of the data set. This aims for both educating drivers on what to be aware on the road and showcasing to government officials the infrastructure they can improve.
