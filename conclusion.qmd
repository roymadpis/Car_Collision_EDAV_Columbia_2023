# Conclusion

In the course of our project, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of car collision data in Montgomery County, extracting valuable insights outlined in detail in the results chapter. WE began to explore our data as a time series to spot seasonality and special days leading to higher or lower car accident. Then, we focused on Hit and Run accidents to find common pattern that could help the police reduce these accidents.

#### Time Series Analysis
In our examination of the time series aspect concerning the date and time of collisions, we identified notable patterns associated with specific holidays - there are some holidays that typically correspond to weeks with higher/lower number of accidents.
Our recommendation to Montgomery Police Department is to increase the presence of officers during weeks corresponding to holidays such as Veterans Day and Columbus Day. While the analysis did not reveal a significant connection between a given month and the number of accidents, it highlighted a substantial correlation between the day of the week and the hour of the day with accident frequencies. A line of thought could be to find alternative ways for workers to go home during commute hours when they feel too tired to drive their cars.


#### Hit-and-Run Incidents Analysis

Within the scope of the **Hit-and-Run Incidents** analysis we found out there is a higher proportion of Hit and Run accidents on weekends and on late hours. That is, if an accident happens to occur at the middle of the week and or at an early time of the day, there is less chance the driver will run away after an accident. This finding prompted recommendations for enhanced road enforcement during these periods, including the consideration of strategic placements of "fake police cars" at potentially risky intersections to deter hit-and-run incidents.
In addition, we discovered that accidents of the type "parked vehicle" - that is accidents where the driver hit a vehicle that was parking, has more than half chance to hit and run (compared to the overall proportion of hit-run accidents). We suggest encouraging people to install a camera in there car that works 24/7 and is able to record such incidents. If enough drivers will do that, drivers in general will be afraid to hit parked vehicles and run away since they would know they would probably get caught and get a more significant punishment. We also spotted the higher occurrence of Hit and Run accidents for non injury accidents and where there is no traffic.

Incidentally, we showed that intersections are locations with higher car crashes in general and traffic lights don't help reduce this number. Contrarily, it appears that intersection with traffic lights has more accidents. Reminding the drivers to as careful at traffic light intersection as any other intersection could help solve this issue.

Finally, Utilizing an alluvial diagram, we uncovered a notable association, indicating that roads configured as two-ways without a central division and lacking traffic controls exhibit the highest likelihood of hit-and-run accidents. We recommend first to investigate these specific spot more into detail to check if these results are more than correlation. Then, an escalation of enforcement measures on such roads, with one potential solution being the strategic installation of security cameras in these identified problematic areas.

We would like to note we have some hypothesis regarding this phenomena:
Roads without traffic controls (such as stop signs or traffic signals) may lack regulated intersections, potentially leading to uncontrolled interactions between vehicles. The absence of clear right-of-way rules can contribute to chaotic traffic situations, increasing the risk of accidents, including hit-and-run cases, moreover, Roads without physical divisions may provide more opportunities for drivers involved in accidents to flee the scene. The absence of barriers or medians makes it easier for a driver to quickly leave the area without being easily identified. 
However we want to emphasize that correlation cannot be interpreted as causation, so we can only try to reason about our findings, but we don't have the necessary data and tools to test those assumptions.


#### Geospatial Exploration
Within the scope of the **Geospatial Exploration** we analyzed a heat-map of accidents of hit-run type. We confirmed our previous assumptions about the location of Hit and Run accidents. They occur more often in dense urban area around intersections or parking spots. The map also helps to identify specific parking spot in the county with high density of Hit and Run accidents, therefore police could do some experimentation like adding more cameras and see if it impacts the overall number of these accidents.


To conclude, this project aims to help the police mitigate the number of accidents as whole and specifically reduce the Hit and Run ones. Additionally, it seeks to contribute to the public discourse on this issue.
