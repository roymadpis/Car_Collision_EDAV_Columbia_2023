# Conclusion

In the course of our project, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of car collision data in Montgomery County, extracting valuable insights outlined in detail in the results chapter. WE began to explore our data as a time series to spot seasonality and special days leading to higher or lower car accident. Then, we focused on Hit and Run accidents to find common pattern that could help the police reduce these accidents.

#### Time Series Analysis
In our examination of the time series aspect concerning the date and time of collisions, we identified notable patterns associated with specific holidays - there are some holidays that typically correspond to weeks with higher/lower number of accidents.
Our recommendation to Montgomery Police Department is to increase the presence of officers during weeks corresponding to holidays such as Veterans Day and Columbus Day. While the analysis did not reveal a significant connection between a given month and the number of accidents, it highlighted a substantial correlation between the day of the week and the hour of the day with accident frequencies. A line of thought could be to think about alternative way for workers to go home during commute hours when they feel too tired. Notably, weekends and late hours exhibited lower accident numbers, aligning with the expected lower volume of drivers during these periods.


#### Hit-and-Run Incidents Analysis

Within the scope of the **Hit-and-Run Incidents** analysis we found out there is a higher proportion of Hit-Run accident on weekends and on late hours. That is, if an accident happen to occur at the middle of the week and or at an early time of the day, there is less chance the driver will run away after an accident. This finding prompted recommendations for enhanced road enforcement during these periods, including the consideration of strategic placements of "fake police cars" at potentially risky intersections to deter hit-and-run incidents.
In addition, we discovered that accidents of the type "parked vehicle" - that is accidents where the driver hit a vehicle that was parking, has more than half chance to hit and run (compared to the overall proportion of hit-run accidents). We suggest encouraging people to install a camera in there car that works 24/7 and is able to record such incidents. If enough drivers will do that, drivers in general will be afraid to hit parked vehicles and run away since they would know they would probably get caught and get a more significant punishment.

Finally, Utilizing an alluvial diagram, we uncovered a notable association, indicating that roads configured as two-ways without a central division and lacking traffic controls exhibit the highest likelihood of hit-and-run accidents. We recommend an escalation of enforcement measures on such roads, with one potential solution being the strategic installation of security cameras in identified problematic areas.

We suggest the police department to increase enforcement in such roads - one option is to install security camera in those problematic areas.
We would like to note we have some hypothesis regarding this phenomena:
Roads without traffic controls (such as stop signs or traffic signals) may lack regulated intersections, potentially leading to uncontrolled interactions between vehicles. The absence of clear right-of-way rules can contribute to chaotic traffic situations, increasing the risk of accidents, including hit-and-run cases, moreover, Roads without physical divisions may provide more opportunities for drivers involved in accidents to flee the scene. The absence of barriers or medians makes it easier for a driver to quickly leave the area without being easily identified. 
However we want to emphasize that correlation cannot be interpreted as causation, so we can only try to reason about our findings, but we don't have the necessary data and tools to test those assumptions.




#### Geospatial Exploration
Within the scope of the **Geospatial Exploration** we analyzed a heat-map of the accidents in general and the accidents of hit-run type.
